### Scripts

#### Meta
These are PowerShell scripts that help me write other PowerShell scripts. Very meta.
* __`New-Function`__ - A function that creates a new function from scratch. Lots of parameters to specify name, params, comment-based help, etc. Includes checking to ensure the name is well-formed and verb is approved.
